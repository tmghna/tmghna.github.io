# My personal CV

I am Tamaghna Dey, a sophomore undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali with a Chemistry and Physics pre-major. 

My primary interests lie in applied computer science, physical chemistry, statistics, and anything that bridges theory and experimentation. 

I am interested in working with molecular dynamics simulations, time-resolved spectroscopy, genomic, and related large-scale datasets—applying sophisticated statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies for prediction and modelling. 

I am deeply interested in computational logic, namely algorithm formulation, automated workflows, and information and graph theory.

Recently, I have become interested in cryptography and computer networks, and their implications for managing cyber threats.

I also have a keen interest in the history of science, ethical philosophy and epistemology.

Apart from academics, I love multiple sports, especially table tennis and have participated in multiple amateur and professional tournaments. In my free time, I also like to run marathons and practice calisthenics.
