I am Tamaghna Dey, a sophomore undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali with a Chemistry and Physics pre-major. \
My primary interests lie in applied computer science, physical chemistry, statistics, and anything that bridges theory and experimentation. \
I am interested in working with molecular dynamics simulations, time-resolved spectroscopy, genomics, and related large-scale datasets—applying sophisticated statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies for prediction and modelling. \
I am deeply interested in computational logic, namely algorithm formulation, automated workflows, and information and graph theory. \
I also have a keen interest in reading about the history of science, ethical philosophy and epistemology. \
Apart from academics, I love multiple sports, especially table tennis and have participated in multiple amateur and professional tournaments. In my free time, I also like to run marathons and practice calisthenics.
<!-- 
Recently, I have become interested in cryptography and computer networks, and their implications for managing cyber threats. -->
